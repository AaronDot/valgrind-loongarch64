# Valgrind â€“ LOONGARCH64/Linux with vector support

This branch (`loongarch64-linux-vector`) contains Valgrind with support for the LOONGARCH64/Linux platform, specifically focusing on vector support.

The `loongarch64-linux` branch has been tested with Glibc version 2.37.
It's important to be aware that starting from Glibc version 2.38, vector support is required.

**Note: This branch is under development and is not stable.**
